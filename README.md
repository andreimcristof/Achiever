## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you accept Pull Requests?

It depends:

- Since this is mostly a project intended for a YouTube series, I should be the one that decides the features for the project, so feature pull requests will probably not be accepted at this time (maybe later).
- However, if you find a bug and would like to contribute by fixing it, it is highly appreciated.

### Can I fork and make my own spin-off from your project?

It has an MIT license, so feel free to act according to the license.
