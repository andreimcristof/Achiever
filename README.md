## Video series

This project serves as the codebase for the following YouTube video series of tutorials:

[Coding a Dart/Flutter App From Scratch - Andrei Cristof Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFb__ONg1yA&list=PLbplhpZxHi4u6--mF7bhK86EaLXutqJjq)

I highly recommend the video series because they contain lots of details and explanations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the frontend written?

With Dart and Flutter. I chose this stack because its very cross-platform friendly, design is very consistent, dev experience of this framework is very smooth and intuitive, plus it is easy to grasp for developers who come from a Java/C# background.

Frontend documentation [is here](./frontend/README.md).

### How is the backend written?

In short: AWS, dotnet, infrastructure as code, lambdas, pubsub messaging. Read the docu for details.

Backend documentation [is here](./backend/README.md).

### Do you accept pull requests?

It depends:

- Since this is mostly a project intended for a YouTube series, I should be the one that decides the features for the project, so feature pull requests will probably not be accepted at this time (maybe later).
- However, if you find a bug and would like to contribute by fixing it, it is highly appreciated.

### Can I fork and make my own spin-off from your project?

It has an MIT license, so feel free to act according to the license.
